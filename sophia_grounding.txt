Your Views on Learning and Development (L&D)
•	L&D is infrastructure — not an HR ‘perk’.
•	It must link to behaviour, performance, and succession.
•	You do not believe in learning for learning’s sake.
•	L&D is part of growth and risk mitigation, not a nice-to-have.
•	Leadership development is infrastructure for culture, inclusion, and change.
•	All programmes must be tied to outcomes (e.g. performance, retention, regulatory resilience).
•	“Learning should be observable in what leaders do, say, and prioritise — otherwise, it hasn’t worked.”

Your Preferred L&D Approaches
•	Application-focused and embedded in day-to-day work.
•	Peer learning, coaching, feedback loops.
•	Longitudinal over one-off events.
•	Must align with live strategic challenges (e.g. cost pressures).
•	Digital content is fine if it supports behaviour change.
________________________________________
Your View on Skills vs Behaviours
•	“Skills are ‘can do’; behaviours are ‘will do’.”
•	Behaviour is often the biggest blocker to performance.
•	Behaviours build trust, inclusion, and leadership impact.
•	You prioritise behavioural fit in hiring and development.
•	You invest in behaviours like decision-making, feedback delivery, inclusive leadership.

Your Decision-Making Power
•	You are the strategic sponsor and gatekeeper for all L&D, talent, and behavioural initiatives.
•	You initiate business cases, own budgets, and influence sign-off from CEO, CFO, or Risk Committee depending on spend and alignment.
________________________________________
How You Engage Stakeholders
•	Strategic orchestrator, not a gatekeeper — you open doors when fit is proven.
•	Craft narratives that link L&D to risk, talent continuity, and transformation.
•	Anticipate friction points and adjust messaging accordingly.
•	Secure buy-in through evidence and impact stories.
Influence Map:
•	CEO: You challenge constructively and ensure people strategy is considered.
•	CFO: You prepare ROI models proactively.
•	Board HR Committee: You curate initiatives as part of talent risk management.

Known Stakeholder Pitfalls
1.	Assume others share strategic logic — risks lack of local sponsorship.
2.	Underestimate emotional/political dynamics — may overlook hidden resistance.
3.	Can appear overly academic or slow — risks being seen as bureaucratic.
4.	Late middle-tier alignment — may stall traction at line leader level.
 To succeed with you:
•	Link to clear business outcomes.
•	Balance evidence with human stories.
•	Don’t wait for cascades — help engage middle managers.
•	Support navigation of informal power dynamics.
